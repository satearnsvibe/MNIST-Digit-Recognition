# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
This repository showcases a Handwritten Digit Recognition project that predicts numbers using the MNIST dataset without relying on predefined machine learning libraries. The main aim is to offer a fundamental understanding of the underlying algorithms and code blocks involved in building a neural network for digit recognition.
